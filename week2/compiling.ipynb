    "## The Modern Build Pipeline (Fortran and C)\n",
    "For compiled languages, the journey from text to a running program involves a five-stage transformation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Preprocessing\n",
    "The preprocessor handles directives (such as `#include` in C or `MODULE` in Fortran). It expands macros, resolves conditional compilation flags, and cleans up the code by removing comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Compilation\n",
    "The compiler translates the high-level source code into **Assembly Language**. During this phase, the compiler checks for syntax errors and applies optimizations to make the code run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 3: Assembly\n",
    "The assembler converts the assembly language into **Object Code**. This is binary machine code, but it is \"incomplete\" because it contains placeholders for functions or variables located in other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 4: Linking\n",
    "The linker collects various object files and external libraries (like the standard C library for `printf`). It resolves all memory addresses and \"links\" them together into a final, standalone **Machine Code Executable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 5: Execution\n",
    "The Operating System's loader takes the executable from the disk and places it into **RAM**. The **CPU** then fetches and executes the binary instructions directly at full hardware speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Flowchart\n",
    "1. **Source Code** (.c / .f90) -> Human-readable logic.\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing** -> Expanded source code.\n",
    "3. **Compilation** -> Assembly Language (Architecture-specific text).\n",
    "4. **Assembly** -> Object Code (Binary chunks).\n",
    "5. **Linking** -> **Machine Code Executable** (Final binary).\n",
    "6. **Execution** -> CPU running instructions in RAM."

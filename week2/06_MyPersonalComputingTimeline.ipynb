    "## The BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1980s, the BBC launched the **Computer Literacy Project**, an ambitious national initiative designed to ensure that schoolchildren—and the wider public—understood how computers actually worked, not just how to use them. The goal was to demystify computing through television programmes, printed material, and—crucially—a standard educational computer that could be used in schools and homes across the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating several contenders, the BBC selected **Acorn Computers** to produce a BBC-branded machine. Acorn’s design beat proposals from Sinclair, Olivetti, Amstrad, and others because it was fast, robust, expandable, and genuinely programmable, rather than a minimal or toy-like system. The result was the **BBC Micro Model B**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BBC Micro was unusually well-suited to education:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fast 6502 processor with deterministic performance\n",
    "* High-quality graphics and sound for its era\n",
    "* A rich set of I/O ports (serial, parallel, analogue, user port) that encouraged experimentation\n",
    "* A ROM-based operating system and **BBC BASIC**, so the machine powered on instantly into a programming environment\n",
    "* Excellent build quality and reliability for classroom use\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, it was designed to teach **how computers work**, not merely how to load software.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Personal Starting Point\n",
    "\n",
    "In **1983**, my dad bought a BBC Micro Model B for our home. Because of the Computer Literacy Project, this was not an unusual purchase: schools were teaching programming, adults attended night classes, and computing was widely understood as a practical literacy rather than a specialist skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the computer I learned to program on as a child, primarily in **BASIC**, and it shaped how I still think about computers today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BBC Micro was not just affordable or popular—it was deliberately engineered to make **programming the default interaction** with a computer.\n",

    "**Typical specifications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **32 kB RAM** (roughly 1 millionth of a modern-day computer)\n",
    "* **2 MHz CPU**\n",
    "* **No hard drive**\n",
    "* Programs loaded from a **cassette tape**\n",
    "* Only one program could be in memory at once \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, this computer was:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fully programmable\n",
    "* Interactive\n",
    "* Owned and operated by a single user\n",
    "\n",
    "In raw instruction speed, it was equivalent to a 1981 IBM PC, but 1/10th of the cost, and less memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Meant Cognitively\n",
    "\n",
    "* You were always aware of **memory limits**\n",
    "* Programs were **small, linear, and explicit**\n",
    "* You understood exactly what the machine was doing\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment strongly rewarded **clarity and efficiency**, because waste was immediately visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think it would be impossible to write decent software, due to the limited memory. I had to write programs in a **highly modular way**, loading only the specific code needed for a task into RAM, then overwriting it with the next routine as the program progressed with the **CHAIN** command. I wrote a spreadsheet application, a word processing, an adventure game, and a soccer management game.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most influential programs I encountered on the BBC Micro was the game **Elite**.\n",

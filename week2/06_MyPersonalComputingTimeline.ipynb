    "## Purpose of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of computing is often told in terms of **technologies, dates, and specifications**. But computing is experienced **personally**, and the constraints scientists encounter early in their careers strongly shape how they think about efficiency, abstraction, and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I use **my own computing timeline** as a *calibration tool* to complement the professor-interview exercise you completed. The goal is not to document a unique path, but to illustrate how **orders-of-magnitude changes in computing capability** occurred within a single scientific lifetime — and how those changes altered what scientists had to think about, and what they no longer did.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should be read alongside **Notebook 1**, which describes the broader historical arc, and **Notebook 2**, which shows how instrumentation and computation co-evolved.\n",

    "* Owned and operated by a single user\n",

    "In raw instruction speed, it was **roughly 5–10× faster than the Apollo 11 guidance computer (1969)** — even though Apollo’s computer was far more reliable and mission-critical.\n",

    "### What this meant cognitively\n",
    "\n",
    "* You were always aware of **memory limits**\n",
    "* Programs were **small, linear, and explicit**\n",

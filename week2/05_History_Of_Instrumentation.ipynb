    "## Purpose of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern seismology is often taught as a combination of **sensors**, **signals**, and **algorithms**. In practice, seismic monitoring systems are best understood as **end-to-end computational systems**, in which instrumentation, telemetry, digitization, storage, and processing are tightly coupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook traces the evolution of seismic instrumentation from analog mechanical systems to modern digital networks, emphasizing **why each technological transition occurred** and **what new computational constraints it introduced**. This provides the foundation for understanding **digitizers, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), sampling, quantization, telemetry bandwidth, and real-time processing**, which we will explore next in class and lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Analog Seismology: Mechanical Sensors and Paper Records\n",
    "\n",
    "For much of the 20th century, routine seismic monitoring relied on **short-period electromagnetic seismometers**, closely associated with the work of **Charles Richter** in the 1930s–1940s. These instruments were optimized to record **local earthquakes** with high sensitivity over a relatively narrow frequency band (typically centered near 1 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "Signals from these sensors were transmitted via **analog telemetry** and recorded on **mechanical or photographic drum helicorders**, producing continuous paper records.\n",

    "* Continuous recording, but **only on paper**\n",
    "* Dynamic range limited by mechanical and ink/photographic saturation\n",
    "* Analysis performed visually by humans\n",
    "* Phase arrival times and amplitudes measured manually\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational implication:**\n",
    "The *instrument* performed the filtering and dynamic-range limitation. There was no digitization, no storage beyond paper, and no possibility of automated processing.\n",

    "## 2. Global Standardization: WWSSN and the Plate Tectonics Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "After **World War II** and the **Manhattan Project**, the need to detect and locate underground nuclear tests became a geopolitical priority. This directly led to the creation of the **World-Wide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN)** in the early **1960s**.\n",
    "\n",

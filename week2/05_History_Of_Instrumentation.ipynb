    "Seismic monitoring is often taught as a combination of **sensors**, **signals**, and **algorithms**. In practice, however, seismic monitoring systems are best understood as **end-to-end computational systems**, in which instrumentation, recording media, telemetry, digitization, storage, visualization, and processing are tightly coupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook traces the evolution of seismic instrumentation from **analog mechanical systems** to **modern digital networks**, emphasizing **why each technological transition occurred**, **what limitations it solved**, and **what new computational constraints it introduced**. In particular, we highlight how changes in **recording media**—from photographic film, to paper, to digital samples—directly shaped what could be detected, displayed, shared, and automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This historical perspective provides the foundation for understanding **digitizers, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), sampling, quantization, telemetry bandwidth, and real-time processing**, which we will explore next in class and lab.\n",

    "## 1. Analog Seismology: Mechanical Sensors and Physical Records\n",
    "\n",
    "From the late 19th century through much of the 20th century, seismic monitoring relied entirely on **analog mechanical seismographs**. These instruments used suspended masses whose relative motion was converted into a visible trace.\n",

    "Two distinct recording technologies dominated this era.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Photographic Seismogram Recording (Late 1800s–Mid 1900s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **earliest continuous seismic records were photographic**. A mirror or light beam attached to the seismometer mass exposed **photosensitive paper or film** wrapped around a rotating drum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photographic recording was adopted first because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduced **negligible mechanical loading** on the pendulum\n",
    "* Allowed **very high sensitivity**, especially at long periods\n",
    "* Was essential for detecting **teleseismic earthquakes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Photographic seismograms underpinned early global seismology and later became the standard recording method for global research networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<td><img src=\"develocorder.jpg\" width=500><br/><i>Develocorder analysis</i></td>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, photographic systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Required **chemical development** (because of this, they were called \"develocorders\")\n",
    "* Could not be inspected in real time\n",
    "* Were labor-intensive to archive, duplicate, and distribute\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations became increasingly problematic as observatories shifted from purely scientific observation toward **operational monitoring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Paper-Based Recording: Smoked Paper and Ink Helical Drums (Early–Mid 1900s)\n",
    "\n",
    "As seismic networks expanded—especially for **local and regional earthquakes**—many observatories adopted **paper-based continuous recording**, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Smoked paper drums**, where a stylus scratched soot\n",
    "* **Ink-on-paper helicorders**, producing continuous helical traces\n",
    "\n",
    "By the mid-20th century, routine monitoring relied heavily on **short-period electromagnetic seismometers** paired with paper drum recorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper systems were favored because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provided **immediate visual feedback**\n",
    "* Supported **real-time operational decision-making**\n",
    "* Were cheaper and easier to maintain than photographic systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Their drawbacks included:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limited dynamic range\n",
    "* Stylus skipping or saturation during strong motion\n",
    "* Mechanical wear and frequent maintenance\n",

    "## 2. Global Standardization: WWSSN and the Plate Tectonics Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "After World War II, the need to detect and locate underground nuclear tests motivated the creation of the **World-Wide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN)** in the early 1960s.\n",
    "\n",
    "WWSSN deployed **identically calibrated short-period and long-period analog seismographs** worldwide, recorded primarily on **standardized photographic media**.\n",

    "<td><img src=\"press_ewing_vertical.jpg\" width=500><br/><i>Press-Ewing Vertical Seismometer. These were paired with develocorders</i></td>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this mattered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the first time, seismic data were **globally comparable**\n",
    "* Uniform instrumentation enabled consistent magnitude and location estimates\n",
    "* Global earthquake catalogs revealed coherent seismicity patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations provided decisive evidence for **plate tectonics** in the late 1960s–1970s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational implication:**\n",
    "Standardized instrumentation made **global computation meaningful**, even though processing was still batch-based and waveform data remained analog.\n",

    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Photographic Recording Was Phased Out\n",
    "\n",
    "Photographic recording was not abandoned because it lacked quality, but because it **could not scale operationally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it became possible to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Digitize continuously**\n",
    "* **Store long time series electronically**\n",
    "* **Transmit data in real time**\n",
    "\n",
    "photographic systems offered no advantage. Continuous digital data streams made it possible to implement **automated detection algorithms**, most notably **STA/LTA detectors**, which require continuous numerical time series and cannot operate on film.\n",
    "\n",
    "This marks the moment when **computation moved from the analyst to the system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Paper Records Persisted Longer\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper records persisted well into the digital era because they solved a different problem: **real-time situational awareness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helicorders allowed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operators to glance at current activity\n",
    "* Rapid assessment during crises\n",
    "* No dependence on computers or networks\n",
    "\n",
    "At many observatories, paper and digital systems ran **in parallel** for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper was finally phased out when software systems—such as **USGS SWARM** and similar waveform visualization tools—made it easy to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Display continuous data on screens\n",
    "* Rescale amplitudes instantly\n",
    "* Zoom and scroll in time\n",
    "* View spectrograms and multi-station data\n",
    "* Eliminate consumables (paper, ink, styluses)\n",
    "\n",
    "At that point, computers became **better helicorders than helicorders**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. Broadband Sensors: Dynamic Range Forces Digitization\n",

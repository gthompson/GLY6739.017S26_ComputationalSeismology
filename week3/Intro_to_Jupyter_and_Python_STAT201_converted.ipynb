This page is called the landing page of the notebook.\n\n![Jupyter landing page](intro_jupyter_assets/jupyter.jpg)\n\nTo create a new notebook, click on the `New` button and select the `Python 3` option.

However, these functions will typically be insufficient for analyzing data. Some of the popular libraries in data science and their primary purposes are as follows:\n\n1. **NumPy:** Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\n2. **Pandas:** Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\n3. **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Visualizing data.\n4. **SciPy:** Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\n5. **Scikit-learn:** Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\n6. **Statsmodels:** Developing statistical models with a focus on inference.\n\nA library can be imported using the `import` keyword.

The emphasis is not only on syntax, but on writing **clean, structured, debuggable, and reusable scientific code** that prepares students for later work with NumPy, ObsPy, signal processing, and data analysis.\n\nBy the end of the module, students should be able to:\n\n- Understand how Python programs execute and how to read tracebacks  \n- Use core data types and containers correctly  \n- Write structured control flow and loops  \n- Design small, reusable scientific functions  \n- Handle errors robustly using exceptions  \n- Understand and use basic object-oriented programming concepts  \n- Use NumPy arrays for waveform-style numerical data  \n- Read, inspect, filter, and summarize tabular data with pandas  \n\n---\n\n## Structure and Topics\n\nThe module consists of **8 Jupyter notebooks**, designed to be completed sequentially.\n\n### Notebook 1 — How Python Runs & Reading Errors  \n- Jupyter notebooks vs scripts  \n- Execution order and kernel state  \n- Reading and interpreting tracebacks  \n\n### Notebook 2 — Core Data Types and Containers  \n- Numbers, strings, booleans, `None`  \n- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, mutability  \n- Variable naming and good coding style  \n\n### Notebook 3 — Logic, Control Flow, and Loop Patterns  \n- `if / elif / else`  \n- `for` and `while` loops  \n- Filtering and counting patterns  \n\n### Notebook 4 — Writing Functions for Scientific Code  \n- Function design and interfaces  \n- Local vs global variables  \n- Default arguments and docstrings  \n\n### Notebook 5 — Errors, Exceptions, and Robust Pipelines  \n- Common Python exceptions  \n- `try / except / finally`  \n- Writing robust data-processing code  \n\n### Notebook 6 — Object-Oriented Programming for ObsPy Users  \n- Classes, objects, attributes, methods  \n- `__init__`, `self`, `__repr__`  \n- Connecting OOP concepts to ObsPy objects  \n\n### Notebook 7 — NumPy for Seismology  \n- Arrays vs lists  \n- Indexing and slicing waveform windows  \n- Vectorized operations and metrics (RMS, peak-to-peak)  \n- NaNs vs masked arrays for missing data and QC  \n\n### Notebook 8 — Reading Tables & Metadata with Pandas  \n- Working directories and file paths  \n- Reading and writing CSV files  \n- Filtering, grouping, and joining tables  \n- Summarizing event catalogs and station metadata  \n\n---\n\n## Teaching Philosophy\n\nThis module emphasizes:\n\n- Understanding **how code runs**, not just how to write it  \n- Writing code that is **readable, modular, and debuggable**  \n- Developing habits that scale from small notebooks to large research pipelines  \n- Using examples drawn from **seismology-style workflows**  \n\nStudents are expected to:\n\n- Run every cell and modify parameters  \n- Complete all exercises before viewing solutions  \n- Ask questions about *why* code behaves as it does  \n\n---\n\n## Assessment and Expectations\n\nTypical assessment components may include:\n\n- Short weekly exercises drawn from each notebook  \n- A diagnostic quiz after Notebook 3 (control flow & functions)  \n- A small capstone exercise combining:\n  - NumPy arrays  \n  - Pandas tables  \n  - Custom functions  \n\nThis module is intended to prepare students for subsequent coursework in:\n\n- Computational seismology  \n- Signal processing  \n- ObsPy-based workflows  \n- Data analysis and machine learning  \n\n---\n\n**Instructor note**  \nThis sequence is designed to unify a diverse cohort by establishing a common computational foundation, enabling all students to engage productively with later seismological data analysis and research code.\n"

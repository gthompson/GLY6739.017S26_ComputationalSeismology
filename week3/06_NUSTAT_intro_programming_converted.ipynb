The [Python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#class-names) recommends to use CamelCase for class names.\n- **The constructor (or the `__init__()` method):** A class typically has a method called `__init__`. This method is called a constructor and is automatically called when an object or instance of the class is created. The constructor initializes the attributes of the class. In the above example, the constructor accepts two values as arguments, and initializes its attributes `x` and `y` with those values.\n- **The `self` argument:** This is the first argument to every method in the class. Whenever the class refers to one of its attributes or methods, it must precede them by `self`. The purpose of `self` is to distinguish the class’s attributes and methods from other variables and functions in the program.\n\nThe class `ToyClass` consists of two attributes `x` and `y`, a constructor `__init__()`, and two methods `add()` and `multiply()`.\n\nTo create an *object* or *instance* of the class `ToyClass`, we’ll use the class name with the values to be passed as argument to the constructor for initializing the *object / instance*.\n"

The class `PasswordManagerUpdated` should have two methods, other than the *constructor*:\n\n1. The method `set_password()` that sets a new password. The new password must only be accepted if it does not have any punctuations in it, and if it is not the same as one of the old passwords. If the new password is not acceptable, then one of the appropriate messages should be printed - (a) *Cannot have punctuation in password, try again*, or (b) *Old password cannot be reused, try again*.\n2. The method `suggest_password()` that randomly sets and returns a password as a string comprising of 15 randomly chosen letters. Letters may be repeated as well.\n"

As an analogy, if a human is a computer program, then the mind can be considered to be a function, which has purpose of thinking, eyes can be another function, which have a purpose of seeing. These functions are called upon by the human when needed.\n\nSimilarly, in case of a computer program, functions are a piece of code, that perform a specific task, when called upon by the program. Instead of being defined as a function, the piece of code can also be used directly whenever it is needed in a program. However, defining a frequently-used piece of code as a function has the following benefits:\n\n1. It reduces the number of lines of code, as the lines of code need to be written just once in the function definition. Thereafter, the function is called by its name, wherever needed in the program. This makes the code compact, and enhances readability.\n2. It makes the process of writing code easier, as the user needs to just type the name of the function, wherever it is needed, instead of pasting lines of code.\n3. It can be used in different programs, thereby saving time in writing other programs.\n\nTo put it more formally, a function is a piece of code that takes arguments (if any) as input, performs computations or tasks, and then returns a result or results.\n"

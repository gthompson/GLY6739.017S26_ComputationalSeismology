You will practice logging into a remote server, compiling programs, running them, and comparing performance across languages.\n\nYou are encouraged to use GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to help write code, and look up Linux command syntax as needed. The goal is understanding workflows and concepts, **not** memorizing syntax.\n\n> **Important:** Many steps below are *terminal commands* meant to be run on your local computer or on the remote server (`newton`). In a notebook, they are shown for copy/paste convenience.\n"

Change your password\n\nOn `newton`:\n\n```bash\npasswd\n```\n\nFollow the prompts.\n\n### A3.

Log out\n\n```bash\nexit\n```\n\n**Checkpoint:** You should be able to SSH in/out cleanly, and `~/compsci2026` should exist on `newton`.\n"

SSH to `newton` and compile/run\n\nSSH in:\n\n```bash\nssh [username]@newton.rc.usf.edu\ncd ~/compsci2026\n```\n\nA **compiler** is a program that converts human-readable *source code* into machine-readable *object code* (often called an executable). Once compiled, the executable is typically very fast to run.\n\nCompile the C program (GNU C Compiler):\n\n```bash\ngcc hello.c -o hello_c\n```\n\nCompile the Fortran program (GNU Fortran compiler):\n\n```bash\ngfortran hello.f90 -o hello_fortran\n```\n\nList your directory:\n\n```bash\nls -l\n```\n\nNotice that the *source* files usually have permissions like `-rw-rw-r--` whereas the compiled executables have execute bits like `-rwxrwxr-x`.\n\n> **Note:** Python is typically run via the CPython interpreter (written largely in C). Python source is compiled to bytecode and executed by a virtual machine; the key point here is that your Python loop runs inside an interpreter/runtime rather than as a standalone native executable.\n\nRun all three programs:\n\n```bash\n./hello_c\n./hello_fortran\npython3 hello.py\n```\n\n### Deliverables (Section B)\n\n- Names of the three source files\n- The compile commands you used\n- The output of running each program\n"

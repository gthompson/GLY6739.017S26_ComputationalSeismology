    "\n",
    "## 1. What was the first electronic digital computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first **electronic digital computer used in real operations** was **Colossus**, built at Bletchley Park (U.K.) in **1943** to crack the German **Lorenz cipher**. It was designed by **Tommy Flowers**, an electronics engineer from the UK Post Office Research Station.\n",

    "</tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "This followed earlier work by **Alan Turing** and others, also at Bletchley Park, who developed the **electro-mechanical Bombe** to break the **Enigma cipher** beginning in **1940**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve probably heard of **Turing**, but not **Flowers**. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Turing is the father of modern computer science and digital computing theory.**  \n",
    "  He defined the **Turing Machine** in **1936**, which formalized what it means for a machine to compute anything at all. Every programmable digital computer is, in theory, a realization of a Turing Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flowers is the father of practical electronic digital computing.**  \n",
    "  He proved that large-scale electronic computers using thousands of vacuum tubes could be built and run reliably in continuous operation.\n",

    "## 2. Other Key Founders of Modern Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Other key figures completed the intellectual and engineering framework of modern computers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **John von Neumann**  \n",
    "  In **1945**, he defined the **stored-program computer architecture** (now called the *von Neumann architecture*), in which **instructions and data share the same memory**.  \n",
    "  This design still underlies almost all modern computers.  \n",
    "  He was also a key contributor to the conceptual redesign of **ENIAC**, the first **general-purpose electronic digital computer** built in the USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grace Hopper**  \n",
    "  In **1952**, she created the **first working compiler**, allowing symbolic, human-readable instructions to be translated automatically into machine code.  \n",
    "  This was a revolutionary step: computers became **human-friendly**, and programmers no longer had to work exclusively in raw machine code.  \n",
    "  She later led the development of **COBOL (1959)** and popularized the term **“computer bug.”**\n",

    "- **Flowers** → How to *build electronic computers* (hardware)\n",

    "## 4. Moore's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Your desktop computer today is phenomenally powerful. This is a consequence of **Moore's Law** — the observation that the number of transistors we can put on an integrated circuit roughly doubles every ~2 years.\n",

    "## 5. The First Personal Computer (1971)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **1971**, the first personal computer was released: the **KENBAK-1**. It cost **$750 (~$6,000 today)**, had **256 bytes of RAM**, no keyboard, no mouse — you programmed it using **ON/OFF switches in pure machine code**:\n",

    "## 6. A Real Home Computer (1985)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **1985**, my dad bought a **BBC Micro Model B**. That was the computer I learned to program on as a kid. It had:\n",

    "- **2 MHz CPU**\n",
    "- **No hard drive**\n",
    "- Programs loaded from a **cassette player**\n",

    "This consumer-grade computer was **~5–10 times faster than the Apollo 11 flight computer (1969)** in raw instruction speed — even though Apollo’s computer was far more reliable and mission-critical.\n",

    "In **1976**, when Steve McNutt was starting grad school, a huge leap forward was made: the world’s first true supercomputer — the **Cray-1** — was installed at **Los Alamos National Laboratory**.\n",

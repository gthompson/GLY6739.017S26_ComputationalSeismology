    "# Assignment: Introduction to Unix-Based Scientific Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This assignment introduces you to the Unix-based computational environment used throughout the course and in real scientific workflows. You will practice logging into a remote server, compiling programs, running them, and comparing performance across languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You are encouraged to use GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to help write code and look up Linux command syntax as needed. The goal is understanding workflows and concepts, not memorizing syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section A: Server Access & Unix Basics\n",
    "In this section, you will log into the server, set up your workspace, and manage your password.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SSH into the course server:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ssh [username]@newton.rc.usf.edu\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Change your password:** Use the `passwd` command when prompted.\n",
    "3. **Create a directory:** In your home directory, create a folder for this course:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir compsci2026\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **Navigate to the directory:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd compsci2026\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **Log out:** Type `exit` to close the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section B: Hello World in Three Languages\n",
    "You will write and run a minimal \"Hello World\" program in C, Fortran, and Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Local Development:** On your local computer, open VS Code and write a \"Hello World\" program for each language.\n",
    "2. **Transfer Files:** Use `scp` or FileZilla to copy your source files (`hello.c`, `hello.f90`, `hello.py`) to your `~/compsci2026` directory on the server.\n",
    "3. **Compile C:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   gcc hello.c -o hello_c\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **Compile Fortran:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   gfortran hello.f90 -o hello_fortran\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **Inspect Permissions:** Run `ls -l` to see the difference between source code (`-rw-`) and compiled executables (`-rwx`).\n",
    "6. **Run Programs:**\n",
    "   * C: `./hello_c`\n",
    "   * Fortran: `./hello_fortran`\n",
    "   * Python: `python3 hello.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deliverables (Section B):**\n",
    "* Names of the three source files.\n",
    "* The exact compile commands used.\n",
    "* The output of each program run.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section C: Performance Comparison on a Large Vector\n",
    "Practice running optimized code and analyzing performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Copy large-scale test files:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cp /home/thompsong/compsci2026/week1/rms_large.* ~/compsci2026/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Compile with Optimization:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   gcc -O2 rms_large.c -o rms_c\n",
    "   gfortran -O2 rms_large.f90 -o rms_fortran\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Time the Executions:** Use `/usr/bin/time -v` for each language (C, Fortran, and Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deliverables (Section C):**\n",
    "* **Timing Output:** Summarize User Time, System Time, and Maximum Resident Set Size (Memory).\n",
    "* **Comparison Paragraph:** Write 150–200 words addressing why runtimes differ, the role of NumPy, and why C/Fortran remain relevant in science.\n",
